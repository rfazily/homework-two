# GW Coding Bootcamp - Homework #2 due 2/15/2020

## Overview

The purpose of this homework #2 was to create our portfolio sites. The basic requirements included creating an index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html page. In my index.html file, you will see a basic layout of a portfolio site that I plan to continue to build on as this course progresses and beyond.

This entire website was created using bootstrap, along with a very minor amount of CSS that I left in the same file of each page as it pertained to the navbar and spacing issues I was experiencing using the basic bootstrap code. I attempted to keep all of the code organized within the code using the green tags within the sheet.
